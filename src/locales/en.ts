  post1_p1: "In modern operations, AI models must perform far beyond the lab—they must react in real-time, under pressure, and often disconnected from the cloud. DefAgent's approach to post-training AI enables just that: mission-ready autonomy.",
  post1_h2_1: "Why Post-Training Matters",
  post1_p2: "Most AI models are trained on centralized data in ideal conditions. But in tactical environments, conditions evolve. Threats mutate. New data surfaces at the edge. Post-training reinforcement allows DefAgent to fine-tune models in live conditions using reinforcement learning loops and operator feedback.",
  post1_h2_2: "Edge-Tuning in Disconnected Environments",
  post1_p3: "When bandwidth is constrained or cloud access is denied, DefAgent's edge AI modules continue to adapt. Our rugged field devices ingest signals from CVE feeds, local sensors, and radio intercepts, retraining select model layers to improve accuracy in real-time.",
  post1_h2_3: "Human Feedback Loops",
  post1_p4: "Operators can flag, validate, or reject AI suggestions. These signals are logged and used as reinforcement feedback—allowing our models to improve based on field judgment and mission outcomes.",
  post1_h2_4: "Mission-Ready Autonomy in Action",
  post1_p5: "In a recent field exercise, DefAgent's AI system improved its false positive CVE detection rate by 31% over the course of 6 hours through edge feedback and adaptive prioritization. This wasn't done in a cloud lab—it happened on live hardware, in real conditions.",

  post2_h2_1: "What TAK Brings to the Table",
  post2_p2: "The Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) ecosystem has become the go-to platform for situational awareness and team coordination in the field. From ATAK to FreeTAKServer, its modular architecture and open plugin ecosystem offer real-time mapping, asset tracking, messaging, and mission synchronization.",
  post2_h2_2: "Where AI Fits In",
  post2_p3: "AI augments TAK by reducing the cognitive load on operators. Instead of manually parsing dozens of data feeds, DefAgent's AI engine processes CVEs, sensor alerts, and communication patterns to surface only the most relevant and time-sensitive threats.",
  post2_h2_3: "From Information to Action",
  post2_p4: "In the DefAgent+TAK ecosystem, AI-generated alerts can trigger direct in-app overlays, route suggestions, or secure broadcasts to connected EUDs. Whether you're rerouting around a compromised zone or deploying a field response to a new threat, every decision is accelerated by contextual insight.",
  post2_h2_4: "The Operational Impact",
